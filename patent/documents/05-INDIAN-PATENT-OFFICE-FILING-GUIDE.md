**What is a Provisional Patent?**
- A provisional patent establishes your "priority date" (proof you invented it first)
- Gives you 12 months to file complete specification
- Costs less than complete patent (₹1,600 for individual)

**Why File Provisional First?**
✅ Secures your invention date
✅ Lower cost (₹1,600 vs ₹8,000 for complete)
✅ Less formal requirements
✅ Gives you 12 months to refine invention
✅ Can add improvements before complete filing

## 8. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q1: Can I make changes after filing provisional?
**A:** Yes! You can add improvements when you file complete specification within 12 months. This is a huge advantage of provisional patents.

### Q2: What if I miss the 12-month deadline?
**A:** Your application is abandoned. There's usually NO extension. Your invention loses protection and anyone can copy it.

### Q3: Do I need a patent agent/attorney?
**A:** Not required for provisional. You can file yourself (as you're doing). Consider hiring attorney for complete specification (more complex).

### Q4: Can I file international patents?
**A:** Yes, via PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) within 12 months of this filing. Cost: ~₹2,50,000. Only worth it if you plan to sell internationally.

### Q5: What if someone else has a similar idea?
**A:** Your filing date (priority date) proves you had it first. If they file after you, you have priority.

### Q6: Can I talk about my invention now?
**A:** Yes! You're protected. You can:
- Present at conferences
- Publish papers
- Seek investors
- Talk to manufacturers
Just include "Patent Pending" notice.

### Q7: What if I discover I made a mistake in the application?
**A:** For provisional: Not a huge issue. Fix it when filing complete specification. For serious errors, may need to file Form 13 (amendment).

### Q8: How long does patent protection last?
**A:** 20 years from filing date. But you must pay annual renewal fees (years 3+).

### Q9: Can I sell my patent?
**A:** Yes! Patents can be sold, licensed, or used as collateral for loans. "Patent Pending" status makes your invention more valuable.

### Q10: What if Patent Office rejects my application?
**A:** You can:
1. Respond to objections (amend claims)
2. Request hearing
3. Appeal to Appellate Board
Most rejections can be overcome with proper responses.
